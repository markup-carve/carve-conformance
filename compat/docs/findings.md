# Current findings

The expanded sweep measures nine foreign readers through three pinned Carve
engines. Results apply to the declared fixtures and versions. They do not rank
whole languages or establish compatibility with arbitrary documents.

## PHP authored IDs

The expanded sweep found five failed comparisons caused by the PHP canonical
writer dropping authored paragraph and span IDs. JSON retained the IDs, and the
schema already represented them. This was an engine bug.

[Issue #2831](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-php/issues/2831) tracked the
reproduction. [PR #2833](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-php/pull/2833)
fixed IDs supplied without an attribute-order entry and preserved classes when
that optional order was incomplete. The compat PHP pin includes the merged
fix `e15b786c668b5e97207b7d45a5356c9743308ee9`. The five comparisons pass.
Generated heading IDs retain their existing export behavior.

## Representation versus coverage

Carve already represents table captions, columns, widths, cell spans, notes,
checked task items, definitions, attributes and lettered/Roman list styles.
Several adapters support only a subset of those fields. Their loss diagnostics
are adapter boundaries; they do not establish AST design defects.

Positive fixtures now cover lettered and Roman lists, repeated notes in mdast
and Djot, distinct numeric notes, nested task lists, multiple definition terms,
and tables combining Unicode, formatting, links, code and note references.

Pandoc stores note bodies inline without source labels or shared-reference
identity. Repeated references, equal note bodies and out-of-order numeric labels
therefore receive explicit diagnostics. The adapter keeps readable note content
without deduplicating equal bodies. Named and unreferenced notes remain explicit
losses too.

## Rich tables and interchange

HTML and Pandoc adapters retain table captions, column widths, cell spans,
row and cell attributes, explicit row groups, section attributes and block
cells. GFM retains column alignment. Djot retains captions and cell alignment.
Combination fixtures include attributed spanning cells, formatted captions,
multiple body groups, row headers, footers and blocks inside cells. Additional
fixtures combine preserved footers, formatted captions, widths, attributed
cells, rowspans and colspans, including a footer with no leading head. A Pandoc
JSON fixture combines fractional widths with section attributes and block cells.

An authored AST expectation distinguishes these interchange tests from ordinary
Carve source fixtures. They check foreign parsing, schema validity, exact field
mapping, JSON interchange, foreign interchange export and rendered HTML.
Pandoc JSON is the export format for its richer table model; Pandoc Markdown
does not preserve every JSON field. These rows explicitly list their scope.

Carve source cannot spell block cells, section attributes or short captions.
The reference conversion report and each engine's reparsed source changes must
match declared fixture expectations. JavaScript, PHP and Rust preserve multiple
bodies, intermediate header rows, empty bodies and per-body row-header columns
through positional source attributes. Columns remain columns after reparsing;
their added source attributes are recorded as normalization. Decimal percentage
conversion preserves fractional widths.

The new combinations cover a caption, fractional widths, head and foot,
multiple bodies, intermediate headers, row headers and spans; a leading empty
body; middle and trailing empty bodies, including section attributes as a
source loss; no bodies between head and foot; and adjacent plain bodies with
exact widths. PHP retains a header flag on a cell covered by a colspan where
JavaScript and Rust clear it. All three clear the flag on a rowspan placeholder.
PHP's expected source result is engine-specific; the visible spanning cell and
partition stay intact. JavaScript reports the placeholder flag losses through
[PR #2464](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/pull/2464).

[Issue #2457](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/issues/2457) tracked the
missing row-group diagnostic. [PR #2459](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/pull/2459)
fixed reporting, [PR #2460](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/pull/2460)
added simple partition preservation, and [PR #2462](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/pull/2462)
added positional body metadata. Section attributes and block cells are reported
separately. A passing interchange row does not claim a lossless source round
trip: its declared before/after changes show the remaining losses. Native
engines now check those changes, read the reference source, and have their
source read by the reference too; conversion-diagnostic checks still use the
JavaScript reference implementation.

The public HTML importer still drops a leading empty table body without a loss
diagnostic, tracked in [carve-js #2466](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/issues/2466).
The HAST AST adapter preserves it; these interchange rows do not test that
public importer.

Pandoc has no vertical-alignment field. GFM and Djot still have narrower table
models. Unsupported caption structure, column attributes and other fields
continue to require explicit loss diagnostics. HTML width comparisons account
for renderer decimal precision; the AST width assertions remain exact.

## Combination coverage

Nested notes run through mdast and Djot. Definitions containing task lists run
through HTML and Djot. These cases complement repeated notes, nested tasks,
inline table formatting and note references inside table cells.

## Website freshness

Report and manifest requests bypass the browser HTTP cache on page load.
Script and stylesheet URLs include their content hashes so a new deployment
also loads the current application code. A
browser regression test caches an old report, changes the server's report,
then opens the dashboard and requires the new counts without a hard refresh.
An already open page still needs a reload to display a later deployment.

## Shared and independent checks

PHP and Rust add real engine coverage after foreign parsing and mapping. They
share the JavaScript adapters; they are not separate foreign-language importers.
Asciidoctor's DocBook and HTML paths have separate mappers but share one parser.
Generated IDs, renderer navigation and computed note numbers receive visible
normalization diagnostics. Authored attributes remain part of the comparison.

## Input byte lengths and CommonMark example 96

The earlier generated-source report recorded 35 Rust byte-length differences
on CRLF input. Rust counted normalized bytes. Additional cases showed that
both Rust and JavaScript dropped a leading BOM from the count and counted a
NUL as its three-byte replacement character. PHP counted the original input.

[JavaScript PR #2671](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js/pull/2671) and
[Rust PR #2432](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-rs/pull/2432) capture the
original UTF-8 input length before normalization. The provisional compatibility
pins include those PR commits; replace them with commits reachable from each
engine's main branch after both fixes merge. The generated suite now covers 109 inputs, adding BOM, NUL,
lone carriage returns and combined normalization. All three readers agree on
semantic ASTs and report the original byte length for these inputs. Rendering
and source-position checks remain separate observations.

CommonMark example 96 is `---`, `Foo`, `---`, `Bar`, `---`, `Baz` on successive
lines. With the old pins, JavaScript reference rendering treated the imported
opening as frontmatter, losing the rule and first heading. PHP native rendering
differed from that reference. Current JavaScript, PHP and Rust importers retain the rule
and both headings. Each imported result renders correctly through all three
readers. This was already addressed by
[spec issue #2799](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve/issues/2799); the pin
refresh brings that fix into the report. No new PHP parser change is needed.

Proof-profile pins remain unchanged. These results concern the compatibility
readers and their finite fixture sets.

The refreshed readers emit `data-delim=")"` on ordered lists. HTML comparisons
omit this marker only on generated Carve ordered lists with that value;
list starts, other values and other attributes still participate. This removes
three comparison-only mismatches in CommonMark examples 296, 297 and 302.
