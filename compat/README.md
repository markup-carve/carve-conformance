# Carve compatibility

Cross-format AST adapters, tests and measured reports for Carve. The website
shows coverage, source examples, mapped trees, exported source, diagnostics and
pinned revisions for each run.

- [Full methodology and adapter boundaries](tests/external-compat/README.md)

The suite lives independently of the Carve specification repository. It measures
nine external parser targets through pinned JavaScript, PHP and Rust Carve
engines: mdast, hast, commonmark.js, cmark, djot.js, Docutils, Asciidoctor.js,
MD4C and Pandoc. Foreign adapters run through JavaScript. All three engines
check the public importers, mapped AST, JSON interchange, Carve source and HTML.
See [current findings](docs/findings.md) for reproduced engine differences.

## What the report means

Supported fixtures check Carve's AST schema, semantic structure, rendered HTML,
Carve source, JSON interchange and foreign source round trips. Markdown, HTML
and Djot also exercise each engine's public source importer on supported fixtures
without authored AST expectations. The importer record compares its fidelity
report with rendered structure:

- `reported`: structure was lost and the report names a loss.
- `unassessed`: structure was lost and only `fidelity-unverified` was reported.
- `silent-loss`: structure was lost with a clean report.
- `false-loss`: structure was kept but the report names a loss.
- `ok`: structure was kept without a named loss.

Supported fixtures fail on `silent-loss` or `false-loss`. `unassessed` passes the
honesty check unless the engine and format are listed in
[`resources/importer-assessment.json`](resources/importer-assessment.json).
Existing rendering assertions still apply. The assessment lists start empty.
Add a format to an engine's list once it ships construct-level diagnostics for
that format, per [carve#2792](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve/issues/2792).
From then on, `unassessed` fails as an unassessed importer. Reports include the
assessment file's SHA-256 hash.

Loss fixtures require a diagnostic code, fidelity and exact AST path, a valid
fallback tree and retained readable content. A passing loss case records a
known boundary; it does not mean the feature survived unchanged. Empty matrix
cells are outside that target's declared fixture coverage.

The report is a measurement of the listed cases and versions, not a percentage
of all possible documents. Foreign source spans are not Carve spans. List
layout and heading levels have documented boundaries. Asciidoctor's inline tree also has to match a separate DocBook conversion.
Both conversions share Asciidoctor's parser.

## Run locally

Use Node 24 or newer and Python 3.12 or newer. The JavaScript and Python readers
are pinned. Native reader versions are recorded in each report.

```sh
npm ci
npm test
mkdir -p reports
npm run compat:javascript -- --report=reports/javascript.json
```

For all nine readers and three engines on Ubuntu, install Rust with Cargo,
PHP 8.3 or newer, and the native dependencies below:

```sh
sudo apt-get install php-cli php-xml cmark libmd4c-dev libmd4c-html0-dev
python3 -m venv .cache/python
.cache/python/bin/pip install -r scripts/compat/requirements.txt
mkdir -p .cache/compat reports
cc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -Werror \
  "-DCARVE_MD4C_VERSION=\"$(dpkg-query -W -f='${Version}' libmd4c0)\"" \
  scripts/compat/md4c-driver.c -lmd4c -lmd4c-html \
  -o .cache/compat/md4c-driver
npm run compat:provision
CARVE_PANDOC=.cache/pandoc/bin/pandoc \
CARVE_COMPAT_PYTHON=.cache/python/bin/python \
  npm run compat:check -- --report=reports/latest.json
```

`CARVE_CMARK`, `CARVE_MD4C_DRIVER` and `CARVE_PANDOC` select native executables.
The provisioner downloads Pandoc 3.11 with a verified archive checksum and
builds the pinned Rust engine with its lockfile. PHP runs through a small
autoload driver. `--engines=javascript` selects the reference engine alone;
native selections must include JavaScript to provide the mapped baseline.
`--tools=mdast,djot` measures a narrower selection and records every unmeasured
target. Missing readers fail the full sweep instead of becoming skips.

## CommonMark spec examples

This measurement lane imports all 652 CommonMark 0.31.2 spec examples with each
selected Carve engine. Every engine's Carve output is rendered by the JavaScript
reference renderer and compared structurally with the spec's expected HTML.
The comparator removes renderer indentation before tags, collapses HTML whitespace
outside code, trims inline edges in paragraphs, headings, table cells, and definition
terms, and ignores Carve's generated heading IDs and section wrappers. Code whitespace
remains significant.

Documented Carve rendering differences are listed in `tests/commonmark-spec/declared.json`.
Each declaration is rechecked by applying its named normalization to both the expected and the actual
semantic tree; only a matching comparison receives `declared` status. Reports flag
stale declarations when the original comparison already matches and insufficient
declarations when the normalized comparison still mismatches.

The default `pandoc-djot` baseline converts the same examples with pinned Pandoc
3.11 using `pandoc -f commonmark -t djot --wrap=preserve`, then renders the Djot
with pinned djot.js (`@djot/djot` 0.3.2). It uses the same HTML comparator and
shows what a general converter keeps. This is a reference point, not a target
for Carve. Pandoc has no fidelity report, so the baseline has no report class or
honesty outcome. Every row in this lane, Carve and baseline alike, renders with
raw HTML passthrough on. Pandoc writes raw HTML as Djot `=html` raw content, which
djot.js passes through.

Results are `match`, `mismatch`, `declared`, `not-comparable` when the HTML mapper cannot
represent the expected structure, or `failed` when importing fails. Importer
reports have three classes: `names-loss` names a degraded or dropped feature;
`unverified-only` has `fidelity-unverified` without a named loss; `clean` has
neither. Comparable rows also use the five honesty outcomes described above;
`not-comparable` and `failed` rows have no honesty outcome. Totals count each
outcome, and `reportDisagreements` lists examples with different report classes
across the selected engines.

This lane measures all outcomes without gating on honesty. A `false-loss` can
be a real loss that the whitespace-collapsing comparator cannot see. Example 40
drops a leading tab that HTML rendering collapses anyway. JavaScript names
`structure-unspellable`; PHP and Rust report only `fidelity-unverified`.

```sh
CARVE_PANDOC=.cache/pandoc/bin/pandoc npm run compat:commonmark -- --report=reports/commonmark.json
```

The default selects JavaScript, PHP, and Rust. Use `--engines=javascript` for the
reference importer alone, or `--baselines=none` to omit the baseline. The library
function `runCommonmarkSpec` omits baselines unless `{ baselines: ['pandoc-djot'] }`
is supplied. Mismatches never fail this lane's CI step. Infrastructure
errors, including invalid vendored data, engine pin mismatches, missing or
incorrect Pandoc versions, and crashed drivers, fail the run. The report includes
every example and totals by engine, baseline, and spec section.
The site includes the report when present; `--commonmark=path` selects another file.
See [vendored data provenance and license](tests/commonmark-spec/README.md).

## Djot test examples

This measurement lane imports the 268 HTML examples from the pinned djot.js
functional suite with each selected Carve engine. It renders each engine's Carve
output with the JavaScript reference renderer and compares it with upstream's
expected HTML using the CommonMark lane's comparator. Both sides use generated
mode for Djot section wrappers and heading IDs. This also ignores authored
heading IDs, so the lane does not measure them. Divs are kept with their
attributes on both sides, so a lost or extra fenced div counts as a mismatch.
[`tests/djot-tests/declared.json`](tests/djot-tests/declared.json) declares three
documented differences, Carve's `role="math"` on math spans, a lone image
without `<p>`, and whitespace in a link or image destination written
percent-encoded, with the same re-check as the CommonMark declarations.

```sh
npm run compat:djot -- --report=reports/djot.json
```

The default selects JavaScript, PHP, and Rust; `--engines=javascript` selects
only the reference importer. Six examples with renderer options are excluded.
The upstream file list excludes `filters.test`. The report records exclusions,
totals by engine and file, report classes, honesty outcomes, and report class
disagreements. There are no baselines or declared differences yet. An absent
`tests/djot-tests/declared.json` means no declarations.

Mismatches do not fail the CI measurement step. Invalid vendored data, engine
pin mismatches, and crashed drivers fail the run. The site includes
`reports/djot.json` when present; `--djot=path` selects another file.
See [vendored data provenance and license](tests/djot-tests/README.md).

## Build and preview the website

```sh
npm run site:build
npm run site:preview
```

Open `http://localhost:4173`. The builder requires a report with provenance;
it never substitutes sample results. To build from another measured report:

```sh
npm run site:build -- reports/javascript.json
```

The site uses static HTML, CSS, SVG and JavaScript, with no external fonts,
analytics or runtime service. Sources and foreign HTML appear as text, not
executable markup. Browser checks cover desktop and mobile views, filters,
case permalinks, loss diagnostics, unavailable reports and HTML injection.

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:site
```

## GitHub Actions and Pages

Pull requests run unit tests, provision all readers, measure compatibility,
build the website and run browser checks. They upload evidence and a site
artifact without publishing.

Pushes to `main`, daily schedules and manual runs publish through GitHub Pages.
Pages uses the GitHub Actions build type. The deployment environment is
`github-pages`; deployment runs only from `main`.

A comparison failure still produces a report and makes the workflow fail.
Once the site build and browser checks pass, that report can publish with the
failure visible. Setup, unit, build or browser failures prevent deployment.
The previous report stays available with its measurement date; the page flags
reports older than 48 hours.

## Revisions and upstream work

JavaScript is pinned in `package.json` and the lockfile. PHP, Rust and Pandoc
are pinned in `resources/engines.json`; reports include its hash. Rust binaries
also have a build manifest with the source revision and binary SHA-256. The AST schema is
a vendored snapshot whose source revision and license are recorded in
`resources/provenance.json`. Each report also includes its SHA-256 hash, the
hashes of the raw fixture files, tool versions, suite revision and measurement time.

Daily runs test the locked dependencies. Updating an engine, schema or reader
requires a reviewed dependency change and a new measured report. Keep the
schema snapshot and its provenance together when updating the contract.

The pinned Djot writer cannot serialize hard breaks. A tested adapter workaround
keeps those cases measurable and emits a diagnostic. [Djot upstream PR #158](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js/pull/158)
merged the native fix on October 2, 2026. Remove the workaround only after a pinned version
contains it and the regression tests confirm it.
